# Normal Vs Zoomed

## Why do we need this?
Since we scraped images from multiple different sources, there was no standardization in the type of images. Images varied in size, dimensions, resolution and scale. This model deals with solving the problem related to scale of the images.

## Architecture

## How is it done?

We performed an initial manual classification to build our training dataset wherein we segregated zoomed and normal(non-zoomed) images on over 13 categories.Using CNN, we perform image classification to classify the remaining unseen image dataset into Zoomed and Normal images.
